Master SQL Server with Real-Time Bank Project — Full Prompt

I want to learn and master SQL Server by building a real-time bank project database and solving extensive exercises for every topic from beginner to advanced.

Step 1: Create a Realtime Bank Project Database

Database Name: BankDB

Tables: Include realistic banking tables:

Customers (CustomerID, Name, DOB, Address, Phone, Email)

Accounts (AccountID, CustomerID, AccountType, Balance, OpenDate)

Transactions (TransactionID, AccountID, TransactionType, Amount, TransactionDate, Description)

Loans (LoanID, CustomerID, LoanType, Amount, InterestRate, StartDate, EndDate, Status)

Branches (BranchID, BranchName, Location, Manager)

Employees (EmployeeID, Name, BranchID, Position, Salary, HireDate)

ATM (ATMID, BranchID, Location, Status)

Relationships:

Customers → Accounts (one-to-many)

Customers → Loans (one-to-many)

Accounts → Transactions (one-to-many)

Branches → Employees (one-to-many)

Branches → ATM (one-to-many)

Constraints: Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, Not NULL where appropriate

Insert Sample Data:

Add 20–25 realistic records per table

Include multiple account types, transaction types, loan types

SQL Server Compatibility:

Use DROP TABLE IF EXISTS before creating tables

Use proper data types (INT, NVARCHAR, DECIMAL, DATE, etc.)

Add comments explaining each step

Step 2: Topics to Cover with Exercises

I want exercises for each topic that progress from easy → hard, covering everything I need to master SQL:

🟢 Beginner Level:

Intro

Introduction to SQL

Setup Your Environment

Query Data (SELECT)

DDL Commands (CREATE, ALTER, DROP)

DML Commands (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

🟡 Intermediate Level:

Filtering Data (WHERE, LIKE, IN, BETWEEN)

SQL Joins (Basics & Advanced)

Set Operators (UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT)

SQL Functions

String Functions

Numeric Functions

Date and Time Functions

NULL Functions

CASE Statement

Aggregate Functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX)

🟣 Advanced Level:

Window Functions: Basics, Window Aggregate, Window Ranking, Window Value

Subqueries, Nested Queries

CTEs (Common Table Expressions)

Indexing, Performance Optimization

Transaction Management & ACID concepts

Step 3: Problem Instructions

For each topic, provide realistic, step-by-step problems using the BankDB tables

Include expected output tables for reference

Problems should progress from easy → medium → hard

Provide more than 50–100 practice problems overall, not just 10 or 20

For each exercise, I will write the query, and you will validate my solution, explain mistakes, and suggest improvements

Include edge cases: NULLs, duplicates, zero values, large numbers, date edge cases

Step 4: Goal

By completing these exercises, I will:

Master querying, filtering, joining, and aggregating data

Use functions (string, numeric, date/time, NULL) efficiently

Implement CASE statements and window functions confidently

Solve real-world bank-related problems

Understand query execution order and optimization

Be ready to handle intermediate and advanced SQL tasks in projects or interviews

Step 5: Output Requirements

Provide complete .sql scripts with table creation, relationships, sample inserts, and exercises

Include comments explaining each query

Include expected output in tabular format for each exercise

Make it ready to run in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

Step 6: Iterative Practice

I will solve exercises and paste queries

You will validate, correct, and explain

Gradually increase problem difficulty to cover all beginner → advanced topics

Include challenges that combine multiple tables, joins, aggregations, and window functions

Result:
I will go from zero knowledge → confident in SQL Server, mastering realistic banking scenarios with hundreds of practice problems, all recorded in the BankDB.
